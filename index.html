                The Sex Pistols are an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although their initial career
                lasted just two and a half years, they became one of the most culturally influential acts in popular
                music. The band initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspired many later punk,
                post-punk and alternative rock musicians, while their clothing and hairstyles were a significant
                influence on the early punk image.
                The Sex Pistols' first line-up consisted of vocalist Johnny Rotten (born John Lydon), guitarist Steve
                Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock, with Matlock replaced by Sid Vicious (born John
                Richie) in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band gained widespread attention
                from British press after swearing live on-air during a December 1976 television interview. Their May
                1977 single "God Save the Queen", which described the monarchy as a "fascist regime", was released to
                coincide with national celebrations for the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The song was rapidly banned from
                being played by the BBC and by nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it the most
                censored record in British history.
